# Hypertension {#sec-hypertension}

## Screening for HTN

The USPSTF recommends HTN screening for those 18+ yo with office BP measurement and confirmation with out-of-clinic measurements (Grade A)

## Flavors of HTN

-   Elevated BP

-   Stage I HTN

-   Stage II HTN

-   Resistant HTN

-   Refractory HTN

-   HTN urgency

-   HTN emergency

## Inpatient HTN

### Inpatient BP Management

Satya Patel from UCLA has a phenomenal resource he's put together on this. I first caught wind of it from [his tweet](https://twitter.com/SatyaPatelMD/status/1409973787592773632). This is part of the much larger UCLA Inpatient Pocket Card Set available at <http://bit.ly/pocketcardset>.

### Hypertensive Crises

-   Hypertensive Urgency

    -   TODO: read the "Things We Do For No Reason" on Acute Treatment of Hypertensive Urgency

-   Hypertensive Emergency

    -   In patients with acute ischemic stroke, BP \>220/120, and did not receive tPA, reasonable to lower BP by 15% in the first 24 hours
    -   In patients with acute ischemic stroke, BP \<220/120, and did not receive tPA, do not need to initiate hypertension treatment within the first 48-72 hours
    -   Initiate or re-start antihypertensives \~72 hours after acute ischemic stroke to maintain a BP \<140/90

### Things to know

-   Inpatient BP tends to be higher then Outpatient BPs by \~ 7/3 mmHg [@cappelleri2017]
-   Intensifying antihypertensive meds at hospital discharge is associated with an â†‘ risk of readmission and serious adverse events within 30 days. Moreover, outpatient BP was comparable to pre-intensification. [@anderson2019] (Swapnil ðŸ§µ: [link](https://twitter.com/hswapnil/status/1305873824894849025))
-   Polypharmacy among elderly patients often includes anti-HTN meds. OPTIMISE study: non-inferioty study; RCT of 569 patients \> 80 yo comparing anti-HTN medication reduction (stop 1 med) to usual care â†’ anti-HTN med reduction was non-inferior to usual care. [@sheppard2020]
-   Does pain cause â†‘ BP? ([thread](https://twitter.com/AlexChaitoff/status/1317611640909631494))
    -   Yes, can cause transient â†‘ SBP up to 30 mmHg
    -   Mechanism: pain affects the HPA axis and increases sympathetic tone [@saccÃ²2013]
