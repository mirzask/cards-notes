# Impella {#sec-impella}

## Important Numbers

-   Goals
    -   MAP 60-80
    -   CVP 8-15
    -   PCWP ≥ 10
    -   Cardiac Power Output \> 0.6
-   Distance from aortic valve to Impella inlet
    -   Impella CP: 3.5 cm from valve to inlet
    -   Impella 5.5: 5 cm from valve to inlet
-   Calculate PAPI if CVP \> 16

## To-Do after Impella placed and patient rolls into ICU

-   Check to make sure that the Tuohy-Borst valves are locked
-   Record the centimeter mark on the cather (record at the mark closest to the Tuohy-Borst valve)
-   Check volume status and ensure adequate
-   Obtain a baseline echo upon arrival to the ICU (or if suspected catheter movement)
-   Check Foley bag for urine color (signs of hemolysis?) and amount

## Preventing Impella Inward Migration

-   Ensure slack was removed after positioning the inlet area - 3.5 cm for Impella CP and 5 cm for Impella 5.5 - below the aortic valve annulus.
-   Ensure the Tuohy-Borst is tight and note the centimeter mark on the cather.
-   Immobilize the leg if the patient is overactive or uncooperative
-   Obtain a baseline echo upon arrival to the ICU (or if suspected catheter movement)
-   Address positioning alarms
-   If you do have to move the catheter to reposition, turn down to P-2

## Persistent Suction Alarms

|                               | CVP ≤ 12            | CVP \> 12                          |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| Persistent Suction Alarm      | *Low* volume status | Strongly consider Right ❤️ Support |
| *No* Persistent Suction Alarm | No action           | *High* volume status               |

-   In both scenarious (continuous or diastolic suction alarms), check RV function using PAPI (PA pulsatility index) or Echo.

$$
\text{PAPI} = \frac{\text{PA}_{\text{systolic}} - \text{PA}_{\text{diastolic}}}{\text{RA pressure}}
$$

::: callout-important
Check right heart function if persistent suction alarms despite good volume status and correct Impella position.

### Continuous Suction

-   The systolic LV numbers (in white) are uncoupled from the aortic numbers (shown in red). You will see *low* systolic pressures and *negative* diastolic pressures that don't recover (unlike with diastolic suction problems).
    -   The entire LV waveform shifts downward
-   The diastolic LV numbers are also quite negative
-   Max and Min Impella flows are *lower* than expected

-   How to resolve?
    -   Check filling and volume status \> Check Impella position

### Diastolic Suction

-   The LV waveform (in white) will have *normal* systolic pressures, but *negative* diastolic pressures that recover by the end of diastole
-   There will be low diastolic Impella Flow

-   How to resolve?
    -   Check Impella position \> Check filling and volume status

## Bleeding Troubleshooting

-   ACT should be maintained between 160-180
-   Peel-away sheaths should be removed in the Cath lab
-   Minimize unnecessary movement
-   Use leg immobilizer to reduce trauma to access site
-   Check for forward suturing of repositioning unit butterfly

::: callout-warning
If butterfly is flat against the skin, use 4x4s to angle match and reduce lift on vessel (See @fig-impella-butterfly)

## Suspected Hemolysis

::: callout-warning
You should suspect hemolysis if the urine color is red!
:::

-   Rule out blood in urine
    -   Check a UA (fastest)
    -   Check *plasma free* Hemoglobin
    -   Check spun plasma color if *plasma free* Hemoglobin is unavailable
-   Consider giving volume if hemolysis + CVP or PCWP \< 10 mmHg
-   Assess the position of the Impella using Echo
