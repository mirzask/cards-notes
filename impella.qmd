# Impella {#sec-impella}

- Impella microaxial flow pumps are placed fluoroscopically in retrograde fashion through the femoral artery, axillary artery, or ascending aorta
- Blood 🩸 is suctioned from an inlet (located just superior to the catheter’s pigtail in the LV cavity) and then delivered through the Impella outlet, which is seated just above the aortic valve.
- The distal portion of the Impella is a pigtail configuration that is meant to reside in the mid LV approximately ==3.5 cm below the aortic annulus==.
- Uses: high-risk PCI, post-MI shock, ADHF, post-cardiotomy shock, etc.
- Complications
	- hemolysis
	- pigment-induced nephropathy
	- vascular access complications, e.g. limb ischemia, major bleeding
	- pericardial tamponade
	- MV impingement w/ mitral regurgitation
	- thrombosis → device failure
-   Two main ways it helps:
    -   unloading (↓ EDV and EDV) and
    -   outflow (↑ flow)
- Unloads the LV by continuously drawing blood from LV
	- ↓ LV work and myocardial O~2~ demand
	- ↑ MAP and CO
	- Improved systemic perfusion and coronary blood flow
	- ↓ PCWP
	- Reduction in RV afterload
-   5.5 is bigger and runs at lower rpm; less hemolysis than 3.5 or CP

- Aortic Stenosis with AVA 0.6cm2 or less
- Severe PVD
	- May still place axillary or direct aortic approaches
- Presence of mechanical aortic valve

## Important Numbers

-   Goals
    -   MAP 60-80
    -   CVP 8-15
    -   PCWP ≥ 10
    -   Cardiac Power Output \> 0.6
-   Distance from aortic valve to Impella inlet
    -   Impella CP: 3.5 cm from valve to inlet
    -   Impella 5.5: 5 cm from valve to inlet
-   Calculate PAPI if CVP \> 16

## To-Do after Impella placed and patient rolls into ICU

-   Check to make sure that the Tuohy-Borst valves are locked
-   Record the centimeter mark on the cather (record at the mark closest to the Tuohy-Borst valve)
-   Check volume status and ensure adequate
-   Obtain a baseline echo upon arrival to the ICU (or if suspected catheter movement)
-   Check Foley bag for urine color (signs of hemolysis?) and amount

## Preventing Impella Inward Migration

-   Ensure slack was removed after positioning the inlet area - 3.5 cm for Impella CP and 5 cm for Impella 5.5 - below the aortic valve annulus.
-   Ensure the Tuohy-Borst is tight and note the centimeter mark on the cather.
-   Immobilize the leg if the patient is overactive or uncooperative
-   Obtain a baseline echo upon arrival to the ICU (or if suspected catheter movement)
-   Address positioning alarms
-   If you do have to move the catheter to reposition, turn down to P-2

## Malpositioned Impella

-   Impella in Ventricle
    -   Appearance on monitor: flat motor current + ventricular placement signal
-   Impella in Atrium
    -   Appearance on monitor: flat motor current + atrial placement signal

## Handling Device Migration

-   Reduce to P2
-   Under echo guidance, reposition to 3.5 cm below the AV.
-   If fails, then will need to go to the cath lab for repositioning under fluoro guidance

## Persistent Suction Alarms

|                               | CVP ≤ 12            | CVP \> 12                          |
|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Persistent Suction Alarm      | *Low* volume status | Strongly consider Right ❤️ Support |
| *No* Persistent Suction Alarm | No action           | *High* volume status               |

-   In both scenarious (continuous or diastolic suction alarms), check RV function using PAPI (PA pulsatility index) or Echo.

$$
\text{PAPI} = \frac{\text{PA}_{\text{systolic}} - \text{PA}_{\text{diastolic}}}{\text{RA pressure}}
$$

::: callout-important
Check right heart function if persistent suction alarms despite good volume status and correct Impella position.

### Continuous Suction

-   The systolic LV numbers (in white) are uncoupled from the aortic numbers (shown in red). You will see *low* systolic pressures and *negative* diastolic pressures that don't recover (unlike with diastolic suction problems).
    -   The entire LV waveform shifts downward
-   The diastolic LV numbers are also quite negative
-   Max and Min Impella flows are *lower* than expected

-   How to resolve?
    -   Check filling and volume status \> Check Impella position

### Diastolic Suction

-   The LV waveform (in white) will have *normal* systolic pressures, but *negative* diastolic pressures that recover by the end of diastole
-   There will be low diastolic Impella Flow

-   How to resolve?
    -   Check Impella position \> Check filling and volume status

## Handling aberrant purge pressure

-   **High** purge pressure?
    -   Look for kinks in tubing
    -   Can ↓ dextrose in purge solution
-   **Low** purge pressure?
    -   Check for leaks
    -   Can ↑ dextrose in purge solution

## Bleeding Troubleshooting

-   ACT should be maintained between 160-180
-   Peel-away sheaths should be removed in the Cath lab
-   Minimize unnecessary movement
-   Use leg immobilizer to reduce trauma to access site
-   Check for forward suturing of repositioning unit butterfly

::: callout-warning
If butterfly is flat against the skin, use 4x4s to angle match and reduce lift on vessel (See @fig-impella-butterfly)

-    Dr. Hart also mentioned that the following figure 8 suturing technique may be useful to help with access site bleeding (oozing) [@Aytemir2016]

## Suspected Hemolysis

::: callout-warning
You should suspect hemolysis if the urine color is red!
:::

-   Potential obstruction at different levels
    -   Inflow obstruction
    -   Cannula obstruction
    -   Outflow obstruction
-   Rule out blood in urine
    -   Check a UA (fastest)
    -   Check *plasma free* Hemoglobin
    -   Check spun plasma color if *plasma free* Hemoglobin is unavailable
    -   Check LDH
-   Consider giving volume if hemolysis + CVP or PCWP \< 10 mmHg
-   Assess the position of the Impella using Echo
    -   Unobstructed inflow

    -   Approx. 3.5 cm distal to the aortic valve

    -   Free from anterior mitral leaflet

    -   Free from sub-annular structures

    -   Outflow well above the aortic valve

    -   Stable position that does *not* migrate

    -   Reduce flow as tolerated

    -   Pump removal if needed
