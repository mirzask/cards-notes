## AVS for Weight Loss

No one thing universally helpful to lose weight. The weight loss evidence suggests that different things work for different people and it is hard to predict which plan will be best for one person without trial and error. 

There are some weight loss drugs available (some with FDA approved indications for weight loss and some used off-label), but these have only been studied in those with a BMI of 30 or higher. Your BMI today was @BMIE@

There is some more recent studies that the types of food you are eating and when you are eating may matter as much (or more) than the absolute number of calories you eat. In short, it seems like it may be beneficial to eat your calories during a limited time window (10AM-6PM), and to avoid sugar, refined grains (white rice, white bread, etc.) and highly processed foods - this way, you can eat all you want of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and dairy without having to calorie count. Try to limit carbohydrates somewhat or eat carbohydrates in the middle part of the day when your body is best equipped to metabolize these. In particular, avoid eating late at night (after 7-8 PM).

Remember too that getting enough exercise and sleeping enough also seem to contribute to healthy weight loss.
