### STEMI

TODO

## Definitions

-   UA is angina that is either:

    -   new (\< 2 months)

    -   increased in severity or frequency

    -   occurs at rest

-   The difference between unstable angina (UA) and NSTEMI is the absence or presence of cardiac enzymes, respectively.

## MI Subtypes based on etiology

-   **Type 1**: Spontaneous MI due to a primary coronary event
-   **Type 2**: MI secondary to ischemia due to either increased oxygen demand or decreased supply, eg, coronary artery spasm, anemia, or arrhythmias
-   **Type 3**: Sudden unexpected cardiac death, including cardiac arrest, often with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia
-   **Type 4**: MI associated with PCI or stent thrombosis
-   **Type 5**: MI associated with CABG

## Clinical Presentation

> ðŸ’¡Response to nitroglycerin should not be used as a diagnostic test in the evaluation of chest pain.

Assuming a base rate of 15%, i.e. pre-test probability of 15%.

| **Feature or Finding**      | **LR+** | **Post-test Probability** |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------------------------|
| Radiation to both arms      | 9.7     | 63%                       |
| Radiation to right arm      | 7.3     | 56%                       |
| Third heart sound           | 3.2     | 36%                       |
| Hypotension                 | 3.1     | 35%                       |
| Radiation to left arm       | 2.2     | 28%                       |
| Radiation to right shoulder | 2.2     | 28%                       |
| Crackles                    | 2.1     | 27%                       |
| Diaphoresis                 | 2.0     | 26%                       |
| Nausea and vomiting         | 1.9     | 25%                       |

### Factors that increase likelihood of ACS (per ACC/AHA)

-   Chest or left arm pain that reproduces prior angina
-   History of CHD
-   Transient mitral regurgitation murmur
-   hypOtension
-   diaphoresis
-   pulmonary edema
-   crackles

### Mimics

-   Prinzmetal (vasospastic) angina; can be diagnosed in cath lab with ergonovine infusion
    -   Tx: CCBs, nitrates
    -   Clue: ischemia-Sx that occur at about the same time each day; EKG w/ transient ST elevation during pain episode.
-   See [non-cardiac causes of chest pain](chest-pain.qmd#causes-of-chest-pain)

### Likelihood of MI based on ECG findings

-   New ST elevation \> 1 mm, LR+ = 5.7--53
-   New Q wave, LR+ = 5.3--24.8
-   Any ST elevation, LR+ = 11.2
-   New Q or ST elevation, LR+ = 11
-   Any ECG abnormality, LR- = 0.04

### Likelihood of MI based on Troponin

::: callout-warning
Patients with kidney disease often have elevated troponin levels raising the risk of false-positive tests for MI.
:::

-   sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 98%; LR+, 48; LR--, 0.05

## Inferior MI


-   **Inferior MI** may present with acute severe epigastric pain, anorexia, n/v and diaphoresis

    -   Why? â†‘ vagal tone and irritation of the diaphragm by adjacent infarcted inferior wall

-   Every pt presenting with a suspected **acute inferior MI** should get a right-sided EKG

    -   R-sided EKG will show â‰¥ 1 mm ST elevation in leads RV4-RV6

-   If a pt presenting with **inferior MI** **+ hypOtension** â†’ get a R-sided EKG

-   Right ventricular infarction is almost always due to occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA)

-   Clinical triad of right ventricular infarction

    -   hypOtension

    -   clear lung fields

    -   â†‘ JVP

-   In acute inferior MI and PA catheter shows â†“ PCWP, â†‘ RA pressure: give fluids until BP normalizes

    -   What's going on? RV infarct â†’ RV failure, so the RV is unable to fill the L side of the heart

-   Management of RV infarction differs from mgmt of LV infarction in the following ways:

    -   avoid nitrates and other agents that â†“ preload in RVI

    -   *give* fluids if RVI + hypOtensive

-   Cardiac complications more common with inferior MIs (compared to anterior MIs):

    -   bradycardia

    -   AV block

    -   Why these complications with inferior MIs? Due to â†‘ vagal tone and AV nodal ischemia associated w/ inferior infarcts

> Although AV block is more common with inferior MIs. If it does occur with anterior MI, it is due to destruction of a large amount of myocardium in the interventricular septum. âˆ´ AV block in setting of an *anterior* MI is associated with higher mortality than AV block in setting of *inferior* MI (transiet, no ppm required). AV block due to *anterior* MI requires pacemaker placement.


## ECG Criteria

### STEMI ECG Criteria

-   New ST elevation at the J point in 2 contiguous leads \> 1 mm (0.1 mV) in all leads except V2--V3
-   New ST elevation V2--V3 of \>= 2 mm in men younger than 40 years or \>= 1.5 mm in women
-   New, or presumed new, left bundle branch block

::: callout-caution
## Posterior MI may be a STEMI, but appear as ST-depression on a routine 12-lead EKG. Confirm STEMI by obtaining a R-sided EKG.

: Management strategies for patients presenting with ACS/MI (Source: BrighamChiefs, Aug 19, 2020)

-   First med to give to a pt presenting with chest pain and concern for ACS: **non-enteric coated ASA 162/325 mg bite and chew x1**
-   Within the first 10 minutes of the encounter for a pt w/ suspected ACS, do the following:
    -   Give ASA
    -   Obtain EKG, troponin
    -   Obtain H&P
-   Labs
    -   Troponin
        -   first elevated **4 hrs** after an MI
        -   peaks **44 hrs** after MI

![TIMI scoring criteria for UA/NSTEMI](images/cards-TIMI-score-UANSTEMI.png){#fig-timinstemi}

-   For pts presenting with UA/NSTEMI, calculate the TIMI score (Fig @fig-timinstemi) to determine if and when patient should go to the cath lab.
    -   TIMI â‰¥ 3 â†’ Cath lab w/in 24 hrs
-   Patients with ACS who need to go to Cath lab **ASAP**
    -   STEMI
    -   NSTEMI
        -   unstable or cardiogenic shock
        -   severe LV dysfunction
        -   recurrent/persistent angina at rest despite intensive medical therapy
        -   new/worsening mitral regurgitation or VSD (See \@ref(mi-complications))
        -   sustained ventricular arrhythmia

> Historically, a "new" left bundle branch block (LBBB) in the setting of chest pain was to be treated like a STEMI. Recent studies demonstrate that most patients with chest pain and a "new" LBBB do not have a STEMI (Jain et al., 2011; Kontos et al., 2011). ([Source](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/753695_1))

-   If a patient has taken a **PDE-5 inhibitor**, e.g. viagra, you should wait **24 hrs** before giving **nitroglycerin**

    -   Exception: tadalafil (Cialias), where you should wait **48 hrs**

### Conservative (medical) management of acute UA/NSTEMI

-   anticoagulation: heparin, enoxaparin
-   DAPT: ASA + clopidogrel *or* ticagrelor

### Indications for temporary pacing at time of MI

-   Sx bradyarrythmia refractory to meds

-   asystole or sinus arrest

-   complete (3^rd^ degree) AV block

-   Mobitz type 2 (2^nd^ degree) AV block

### Medications with mortality benefit in MI

-   antiplatelet therapy

-   high-intensity statin

-   Î²-blockers (if LVEF \< 40% or prior MI)

    -   all MI pts should be started on a BB after an MI for *at least* 3 yrs. Continue indefinitely if LVEF \< 40% or prior MI.

-   ACEi

    -   only indicated post-MI if LVEF \< 40%, DM, HTN or CKD

-   Order an Echo after a STEMI to evaluate for cardiac function (e.g. EF) and mechanical complications

-   The most important prognostic factor in pts w/ CAD is the *degree of LV dysfunction*

### Indications for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)

-   Left main CAD w/ \> 50% stenosis

-   3-vessel CAD with \> 70% stenosis inÂ *each*Â vessel

-   significant (\> 70% stenosis) in 2-vessels with 1 of these 2 vessels being the proximal LAD \[Left main equivalent\]

-   CABG vessel patency at 10 yrs:

    -   internal mammary artery (IMA) graft: 90% are patent at 10 yrs

    -   saphenous vein: 50% are patent at 10 yrs
