## Note

``` text
Atrial Fibrillation, (*** paroxysmal/persistent/permanent)
- Echo: ***
- CHADS2-VASc score: ***
- HAS-BLED score: ***
- R/R control: ***
    - Goal resting HR < 110 bpm (if Asx and preserved LVEF) [RACE II trial]
    - Goal resting HR < 80 bpm for Sx AF mgmt despite "lenient" rate control [RACE II trial]
    - If recent Dx (within 1 yr), consider rhythm control [EAST-AF trial]
- Anticoagulation: ***
    - Indicated if no significant bleeding risk and CHADS2-VASC >= 2 (men), >= 3 (women)
    - If CKD 5/ESRD -> warfarin or apixaban (5 mg BID unless TBW < 60 kg or Age > 80 yo)
- Consider checking TSH/fT4, Lytes (inc Ca, Mg)
- Treatment of other co-moribidities
    - OSA, HTN, Obesity, EtOH use disorder
- Encourage weight loss (if obese) and abstinence from alcohol (Voskoboinik et al., NEJM 2020)

## Classifications

-   Paroxysmal - terminates spontaneously or with intervention in \< 7 days; recurrence may occur
-   Persistent - continuous AF lasting \> 7 days; requires termination by cardioversion/ablation
-   Permanent - AF \> 7 days; sinus rhythm not possible, refractory to cardioversion

## Anticoagulation

::: callout-warning
Avoid DOACs in patients with **mechanical** ❤️ valves (RE-ALIGN).
:::

-   DOACs for AFib
    -   Dabigatran: RE-LY
    -   Rivaroxaban:ROCKET-AF
    -   Apixaban: ARISTOTLE
-   Perioperative management: often we do *not* need to bridge AC peri-procedurally. [@Douketis2015; @Douketis2019]

## Rate Control Drugs

![](images/afib-rate-ctrl.png)

-   Metoprolol tartrate: up to 200 mg BID
-   Metoprolol succinate: up to 400 mg daily
-   Carvedilol 3.125-25 mg BID
-   Bisoprolol 2.5-10 mg daily
-   Diltiazem (extended-release) 120-360 mg daily
-   Digoxin: TODO

> European Society of Cardiology and NICE guidelines recommend combination therapy if a single agent fails to control HR

## Rhythm control

-   EAST-AFNET 4 trial [@kirchhof2020]

    -   Early rhythm control within 1 yr of AF Dx with antiarrhythmics or AF ablation (+ cardioversion of persistent AF) was associated with reduced risk of CV mortality, stroke, HF hospitalization, or ACS hospitalization (compared to rate-control)

    -   Great [CardioNerds Journal Club on EAST-AFNET 4 trial](https://www.cardionerds.com/cardsjc-east-afnet4-trial/)

## RVR management

-   IV metoprolol 2.5-5 mg over 2 minutes every 5 mins (up to 3 doses)
-   Dilt gtt (if EF preserved)
-   Amiodarone 300 mg over 1 hr, then maintenance over 24 hrs

Formula to convert diltiazem gtt to PO dilt: $\text{PO} = [(\text{IV (mg/hr)} \times 3) + 3] \times 10$. For example, if rate controlled on dilt gtt at 5 mg/hr → PO = 18 x 10 = 180 mg/day.

## Risk factors

-   **Modifiable risk factors**

    -   OSA
    -   HTN
    -   EtOH use disorder

## Cardioversion Rules

-   If AFib d/t thyrotoxicosis, cardioversion is often unsuccessful before restoration of a euthyroid state

-   TEE + therapeutic anticoagulation → cardioversion → at least 4 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation (indefinitely if increased stroke risk)

-   Therapeutic anticoagulation x3 wks → cardioversion → at least 4 wks of therapeutic anticoagulation

-   **If duration of AFib \< 48 hrs**

    -   If HD unstable → just cardiovert, i.e. don't waste time w/ anticoagulation

    -   If HD stable → start on VTE-dose ppx before cardioversion
