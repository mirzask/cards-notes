# Heart Failure {#sec-heartfailure}

## Note

``` text
Acute (on chronic?) systolic (or diastolic) dysfunction - 
- ACC/AHA Stage ***, NYHA Class ***, Stevenson Profile *** (A, B, C, L)
- *** Exam with S3, elevated JVP, skin is warm, dry
- Presence of ICD/ppm?
- Last EF?
- Work-up:
       - EKG: 
       - Imaging: CXR, Echo
       - Labs: BNP, Trop
- Preload: IV diuresis - DOSE trial (2.5x home dose), TDD of home diuretic x2 and give as BID/TID for 48-72 hrs
    - If fails to respond, consider adding 5 mg metolazone 1x and reassess
- Afterload: **continue outpatient ARNI/ARB/ACEi/aldosterone antagonist and beta blocker during diuresis if blood pressure allows (Train et al, 2018)
- Neurohormonal: 
- R/R:
- Ischemia: statin, ASA
- If pt reports muscle aches: give some oral magnesium oxide
- Diet: salt-restricted diet. If class D HF, consider FWR
  - Sodium restriction: 2-3 g daily
- Labs: monitor lytes; maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
    - BID labs?
    - Monitor HCO3 in COPD pts b/c they can start to retain CO2 (resp acidosis) to compensate for metabolic alkalosis d/t diuresis
    - Replete Cl to avoid metabolic alkalosis (esp in COPD pts), e.g. w/ KCl
- Indication for ICD or CRT?
- If HFrEF and *iron-deficiency* (w/ or w/o anemia) defined as ferritin < 100 or 
ferritin 100-299 + transferrin sat < 20% -> IV iron for functional and Sx 
improvement. Studies of the effect on mortality and hospitalization are ongoing, 
as are studies in pts w/ HFpEF.
- If HFpEF - consider spironolactone if elevated BNP, SGLT2i if T2DM
- Encourage lifestyle modifications and optimize co-morbidities
- Daily standing weights
- Strict I/O
- Be mindful of fluids
  - e.g. KVO @ 10 cc/hr -> 2.16g Na/d
  - 1L of NS contains 9g of NaCl versus 1L of LR contains 6g
- Dispo planning
  - Daily home weights; procure weigh scale if needed
  - f/u in clinic w/in 1 week of discharge; f/u K, Cr and meds
```

## TODO

-   Include JCF paper "A Stepwise Guide to the Diagnosis and Treatment of HFpEF" [@vaishnav2022]

## Classifications of HF

-   HF = Si/Sx of HF caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality *plus* one of the following:
    -   elevated BNP
    -   objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion
-   HF with LVEF â‰¤ 40% (HFrEF)
-   HF with LVEF 41-49% (HFmrEF) -- HF with mid-range EF
-   HF with LVEF â‰¥ 50% (HFpEF)
-   HF with improved EF (HFimpEF)

## Precipitants of HF

::: callout-warning
Be mindful of Na^+^ load from 'Keep Vein Open' IVF. KVO w/ NS \@ 10cc/hr â†’ 240 mL â†’ 2.16g of Na^+^. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/RaviPatelDO/status/1293747269020377088)

**FAILURES** mnemonic: [Source](https://thecurbsiders.com/podcast/230)

-   **F**orgetting medication (or taking beta blockers, NSAIDs, methamphetamine, or cocaine)
-   **A**rrhythmia or **A**nemia
-   **I**schemia or **I**nfarction
-   **L**ifestyle choices including dietary indiscretions.
-   **U**pregulation of cardiac demand from either pregnancy or hyperthyroidism.
-   **R**enal failure from progression of kidney disease or insufficient dialysis.
-   **E**mbolus (pulmonary embolism)
-   **S**tenosis from worsening renal artery stenosis, aortic stenosis, or other valvular disease.

## Work-up

-   Exam
    -   JVD: +LR 5
    -   Presence of S3: +LR 11
-   Work-up for *new-onset* HF should include:
    -   TSH
    -   HIV
    -   CAD evaluation
    -   Substance abuse screening: EtOH, cocaine, methamphetamines
    -   If HFpEF + low-voltage EKG, consider amyloidosis
-   **Na**^+^ \< 125 or â†“ by \> 3 during admission is associated with â†‘ mortality

::: callout-note
Neprolysin inhibitors (ARNIs) can artificially â†‘ BNP
:::

-   **BNP** \> 100 pg/mL is predictive of HF ( \> 200 if AFib)
    -   Obesity artificially lowers BNP
    -   Elevators of BNP include female, AFib, ACS, LVH, old age, CKD, etc.
-   **NT-proBNP** \< 300 pg/mL excludes HF
    -   Age cutoffs: \< 450 pg/mL for \< 50 yo, \< 900 pg/mL for 50-75 yo, \< 1800 pg/mL for \> 75 yo
-   **EKG**
-   **CXR**
-   **Echo**
    -   RVSP can estimate PA pressure (PASP)
        -   consider possibility of Pulm HTN in those w/ RVSP \> 40 mmHg + dyspnea (ACC/AHA)

-   **Beta-blockers**: metoprolol XL, carvedilol, bisoprolol
-   **ACEi/ARB**
-   **ARNI** - sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto); See @sec-entresto
-   **Diuretics** - see NEJM review [article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1703100)
    -   Goal fluid removal
        -   HFpEF: 1-2L net negative per day
        -   HFrEF: at least 2L net neg per day ("as much as Cr and BP will tolerate")
        -   If the diuretic response has not begun within a couple hours, increase the dose immediately instead of waiting until the next scheduled dose.
        -   **Loops**, such as Lasix, Bumex, Torsemide
            -   Conversions: 40 mg PO Lasix = 20 mg PO torsemide = 1 mg Bumex
            -   Lasix dosing:
                -   BUN x 2
                -   House of God - BUN + age
                -   Joel Topf - Cr x 20
            -   Dosing during *acute episode* - $\text{home dose} \times 2$ in IV form administered BID/TID for 48-72hrs (Clyde Yancy)
                -   DOSE trial - no diff b/w continuous diuresis vs intermittent IV boluses
            -   NEJM tidbits:
                -   PO Lasix bioavailability is highly variable (mean, approximately 50%; range, 10 to 90). By contrast, bumex and torsemide have higher and more consistent oral bioavailability.
                -   PO and IV doses of bumex and torsemide are equivalent b/c they do not have absorption-limited kinetics
                -   Torsemide has a longer half-life in pts w/ HF (6 hrs) than Lasix (2.7 hrs) or Bumex (1.3 hrs). Thus, in theory torsemide should be more effective, but the data doesn't really pan out.
                -   Torsemide vs. Lasix: Torsemide reduces hospital readmissions for HF [@DiNicolantonio_2012]
                -   Remember that during acute decompensated HF, Na retention is more avid
            -   Bob Centor gives Torsemide (prefers once daily) to new HF pts and existing HF pts who req'd metolazone during hospitalization. He'll then Rx metolazone PRN (based on daily weights). ([Source](https://twitter.com/medrants/status/1167765807776092160))
            -   Michelle Kittleson recommends transitioning to an oral diuretic dose before discharge that results in 500 cc net negative in 24 hours (expert opinion). Rationale: Patients eat and drink more at home. ([Source](https://thecurbsiders.com/podcast/230))
        -   **Aldosterone antagonists**
            -   CrCl \> 30 + K \< 5
            -   useful in HFpEF pts w/ elevated BNP
            -   start at 12.5 mg daily w/ repeat K, Cr in 1 week
        -   **Metolazone** can take \> 24 hrs for the effect to be seen (Dr. Ooi)
-   **SGLT2i** (e.g. dapagliflozin)
    -   DAPA-HF trial: Among individuals with HFrEF (NYHA 2-4, LVEF â‰¤40%) with or without T2DM, the addition of dapagliflozin decreased rates of CV death or worsening HF, as well as all-cause mortality. [@mcmurray2019]
        -   FDA approved SGLT2i in pts w/ HFrEF with or without T2DM.
-   **IV iron** \[FAIR-HF trial\]
    -   if iron-deficiency +/- anemia
        -   ferritin \< 100 *or* ferritin 100-299 + Tsat \< 20% to improve functional status and QoL
    -   oral iron replacement is not effective \[IRONOUT-HF trial\]
-   **Vericiguat**

## Lifestyle Modifications

-   Less than 2L fluid or 2g salt per day
-   Cardiac rehab
-   Exercise: 150 minutes of *moderate* or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity
-   Smoking cessation
-   Decreased EtOH intake
-   Sleep apnea Tx

## "Diuretic Resistance"

-   Ensure adherence to fluid restriction + low-salt diet
-   Ensure pt is not taking NSAIDs
-   Maximize loop diuretic dose (Bumex 12.5 mg TID)
-   Maximize thiazide diuretic (Metolazone 10 mg TID)
-   Maximize other segment blockade (spiro 100 mg TID, acetazolamide 1000mg BID)
