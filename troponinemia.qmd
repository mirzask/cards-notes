# Troponinemia

## High-sensitivity Troponin

- Overcomes early "Troponin-blind" period
-   General 99th percentile reference limit is 19 ng/L (pg/mL)
-   Sex-specific 99th percentile cutoffs for hc-cTnI:
    -   females: 16 ng/L (pg/mL)
    -   males: 34 ng/L (pg/mL)
-   Trend at q1/2/3 hr intervals (as opposed to q3-4h with standard Troponin)
  - Trending q2h/q3h is more commonly seen
  - UMich algorithm: if hs-cTnI increases by ≥ 6, then ACS ruled in

### Caution

- Late presenters with *low* hs-cTn, ∆ may be small
  - In other words, those presenting late may only have a small ∆ in their hs-cTn so don't just rely on the ∆.
- Single sample rule out only if last chest pain > 6 hrs ago (and no recurrent pain)
  - In other words, if pt presents and last CP episode was > 6 hrs ago + hs-cTnI is _normal_ → ACS ruled out
