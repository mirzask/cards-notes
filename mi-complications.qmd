# MI Complications

## Arrhythmia complications

-   Manage acute arrhythmias as you would in ACLS

-   If post-STEMI, a pt has sustained VT/VF \> 48 hrs, then they should get an ICD if VT/VF are *not* due to reversible ischemia, reinfarction or metabolic cause

## Mechanical complications

-   anteroseptal MI → rupture of ventricular septum → acute VSD

    -   will occur 3-7 days after MI event

-   inferior MI → papillary mm. rupture → acute MR

    -   will occur 3-7 days after MI event

-   anterior MI → free wall rupture

    -   will occur 3-7 days after MI event
