-   LR- of a *normal* stress test is 0.15

    -   e.g. pre-test probability of 50-59 yo M with typical angina based on prevalence in this population is 92%. If this patient has a *normal* stress test, his post-test probability is 63%.

$$
\frac{0.92}{1 - 0.92} = 11.5 \\11.5 \times 0.15 = 1.725 \\\frac{1.725}{1 + 1.725} = 0.633
$$

-   First question to ask yourself: "Can this patient exercise?"

    -   can they achieve \> 5 METs

![Algorithm to determine type of cardiac stress test to order.](images/cards-stress-test-algo.png)

-   Indications for *pharmacologic* stress testing:

    -   unable to exercise, i.e. unable to achieve \> 5 METs

    -   unable to increase HR, inc ppm

        -   includes those unable to achieve 85% of max HR

    -   Presence of baseline EKG abnormality, e.g. LBBB ('**V**olks**W**agen **D**rivers **D**on't **L**itter')

::: callout-tip
## EKG cannot be used if either of the following EKG abnormalities are present: V-paced rhythm, WPW, ST depression, Digoxin, LBBB (mnemonic: VolksWagen Drivers Don't Litter) \[Source\](https://www.coreimpodcast.com/2019/04/24/stress-testing/)

-   3 types of stressors:

    -   exercise

        -   pt should be able to get HR to 85% predicted ($\text{Predicted HR} = 220 - \text{age}$)

    -   inotropes (e.g. Dobutamine)

        -   Especially useful for pts w/ hx of bronchospasm (e.g. asthma) or severe carotid a. stenosis
        -   Con: may precipitate arrhythmias, âˆ´ for pts w/ paced rhythm, hx of VT, etc., you're pharmacologic choice will be vasodilator

    -   vasodilators (e.g. regadenoson, adenosine, dipyridamole - RAD)

        -   Mechanism: causes coronary vasodilation via the adenosine receptor â†’ cAMP production â†’ vascular smooth muscle relaxation

        -   When to avoid:

            -   2^nd^ or 3^rd^ degree heart block without a pacemaker
            -   severe COPD/asthma

-   What is the physiologic effect of vasodilators that is used for cardiac stress testing?

    -   dilate and â†‘ blood flow inÂ *normal*Â cardiac vessels; no effect in diseased areas â†’ dilated normal vessels "steal" flow from stenotic vessels â†’ perfusion defects in scans

    -   Note: vasodilators do *not* act by â†‘ HR (like do exercise or dobutamine)

-   5 choices for diagnostic tools:

    -   EKG

    -   Echocardiogram

        -   exercise or pharmacologic (dobutamine is the only option)

    -   Nuclear imaging

    -   MRI ðŸ’°

    -   PET ðŸ’°
