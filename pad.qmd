# Peripheral Vascular Disease

## Note

``` text
PAD
- Consider ABI if not already completed
- Lifestyle modification: diet, exercise
  - Encourage ≥ 30-45 mins of exercise at least 3 days/wk
- Tobacco cessation therapies: behavioral, pharmacologic
- BP control
  - Preference for ACEi
- Cholesterol control: statin +/- ezetimibe and/or PCSK9i
  - for LDL-C/Lp(a) lowering
- DM control (if indicated)
  - Consider SGLT2i, GLP-1
- Exercise therapy, Supervised exercise training
- Antiplatelet therapy
  - Options:
    - ASA or clopidogrel monotherapy
    - if prior PI/CAD and *low* bleeding risk:
      - ASA + rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID
      - ASA + ticagrelor 60 mg BID (prior MI or other need for DAPT)
      - ASA and/or clopidogrel with vorapaxar
    - if prior peripheral revascularization and *low* bleeding risk
      - ASA + rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID (only option shown efficacious in immediate post-revasc setting)
      - ASA + ticagrelor 60 mg BID (prior MI or other need for DAPT) - chronic PAD
      - ASA and/or clopidogrelwith vorapaxar - chronic PAD
- If claudication, cilostazol 100 mg BID
  - avoid if pt has NYHA Class 3 or 4 HF d/t ↑ mortality w/ PDE inhibitors in these pts
```

## History

-   History: pain relieved w/ sitting down or standing still
    -   By contrast, in pts with spinal stenosis, pain is only by sitting down (i.e. Sx persist even if standing still)
    -   does *not* cause nocturnal leg cramps (neither does lumbar stenosis)
-   Intermittent claudication
    -   supervised exercise program is part of the initial Tx regiman in *all* pts w/ intermittent claudication

## Diagnosis

-   Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) interpretation:
    -   normal ABI: 0.91-1.30
    -   mild-to-moderate PAD: 0.41-0.90
    -   severe PAD: 0.00-0.40

![Interpretation of the ankle-brachial index (ABI).](images/cards-ABI-interp.jpg)

-   Duplex (ultrasound + Doppler) waveform interpretation in PVD:
    -   normal → TRIphasic
    -   moderate occlusion → BIphasic
    -   severe occlusion → MONOphasic

## Management

-   Encourage ≥ 30-45 mins of exercise at least 3 days/wk
-   ⚠️ Avoid cilostazol for Tx of PAD in pts w/ NYHA Class 3 or 4 HF
    -   d/t ↑ mortality w/ PDE inhibitors in these pts
-   Patients with *symptomatic* PAD (claudication with ABI \< 0.85, or previous revascularization or amputation) are considered a 'high-risk' ASCVD group and are recommended to be on **high-intensity statin** (See @sec-statins)
-   Anti-thrombotic therapy [@Hussain2018]
    -   Asymptomatic:
        -   AHA/ACC PAD guideline recommends antiplatelet therapy as reasonable if ABI ≤ 0.90
        -   European Society of Cardiology guideline recommends *against* routine antiplatelet therapy in asymptomatic pts
    -   Symptomatic
        -   Tx w/ antithrombotic - monotherapy with either ASA *or* clopidogrel
    -   s/p revascularization (See @fig-padalgo and @fig-pad-bonaca)
-   Indications for surgical intervention for PVD:
    -   rest pain
    -   intractable claudication
    -   non-healing infection
    -   tissue necrosis
