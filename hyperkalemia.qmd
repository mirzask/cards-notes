# Hyperkalemia

    # Hyperkalemia
    - Check BS (hyperglycemia/DKA/HHS), CK, LDH
      - increased AST may be a clue towards cell lysis as cause
    - Re-check K, CBC (thrombocytosis, hemolysis, WBC > 50k)
    - EKG
    - PVR
    - Medication review: ACEi/ARB, NSAIDs, -azole, heparin/LMWH, TMP/SMX, tacrolimus, spiro
    - Consider telemetry
    - Consider other causes:
           - Increased production: TLS (KcUP), rhabdo, high K diet
           - Decreased excretion: AKI/CKD, hypOaldosteronism, volume depletion, type 4 RTA
           - Cellular shift: insulin def, beta-blockers, cell death, acidemia
    - Treatment:
            - r/o urinary obstruction and hyperglycemia
            - 1L NS, followed by IV Lasix (Topf's dose: Cr x 20)
            - Regular insulin 10U IV + D50 (25g glucose) if BS < 250
            - Patiromer
            - Calcium gluconate - 3g IV over 10 mins (lasts 30-60 mins)
              - Calcium chloride has faster onset, but can cause tissue necrosis (should be infused via central access)
    - LR preferable if no metabolic acidosis
    - Low K diet (exclude from fluids, TPN, etc.)

## EKG Changes

![Hyperkalemia ECG Findings](https://mirzask.github.io/med-notes/figs/hyperK.gif)

-   Peaked T-waves

-   Flattening/loss of P wave (loss of atrial contraction)

-   Increased PR interval and widening of QRS complex

-   If severe, \'sine wave\' pattern

> Severe hyperkalemia (e.g.Â K \> 7) can occur without obvious EKG changes [Source](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/hyperkalemia/)
