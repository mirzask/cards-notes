Dr. O’Keefe gave an example of post-transplant patient on Atorva 80 who got rhabdo and died a few months later.\nDelta between 40 mg and 80 mg of atorva is 48% → 51% reduction (delta is only 3%)\n\nAtorva is the 🌟\nRule of thumb: 6% reduction when doubling a statin dose. Better off adding ezetimibe: zetio on its own 16% reduction, zetia + statin (synergistic effect): 25% reduction.\nNewborn baby LDL is 25-30 mg/dL. Hunter/gatherers have also been studied and have like 40-50 mg/dL.\n\nYou don’t want a 0 LDL! Cholesterol is an important molecule, so you need some.\n\nDr. O’Keefe gets nervous getting someones LDL < 30\nSide effects are not related to LDL level, rather related to statin dose.\nMnemonic for statin side effects “LIPITOR”:\n\nLiver effects\nIncreased blood sugar\nPain (muscles)\nImpaired memory\nTiredness/Fatigue\nOther (headaches)\nRhabdomyolysis\n\nSAMSON trial (BMJ, 2021)\n\n200 statin intolerant patients; “n-of-1” experiments\nCompared atorva 20 mg vs placebo\nIntolerable muscle sx: 9% in statin group discontinued, 7% discontinued placebo\n\nDr. O’Keefe: “when I start someone on a statin, I also start them on CoQ10.”\n\nIf patient c/o myalgias, he’ll increase the dose of CoQ10\n\nPitavastatin\n\na “cool” statin\nNot as strong as atorva\n4 mg dose \\(\\approx\\) 20 mg of atorva\nUnlike atorva, rosuva, simva, Pitavastatin less likely to induce DM in patients. If anything pitava can lower A1c by 0.1%\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Ezetimibe\n\nDr O’Keefe loves ezetimibe\nEWTOPIA75 study out of Japan: zetia monotherapy vs control\nIMPROVE-IT trial\n\ncompared to folks on simva vs simva +zetia: combo further reduced cardiovascular events\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 PCSK9 inhibitors\n\nEvolocumab → reduction of MACE\nInjection once every 2 weeks\nAlirocumab and Lp(a)\nStatins, exercise, diet don’t do anything to effect Lp(a)\nDon’t do anything for TG or HDL, purely work on LDL\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Omega-3\n\nREDUCE-IT trial → ↓ MACE 26%\n\nicosapent ethyl (Vascepa) vs placebo\n\nYou want to get TG < 150\nDr O’Keefe: everybody should be on 1g of EPA+DHA\n\nIf strong indications (hyperTG, atherosclerosis) at least 2g\nIn certain patients, up to 4g/day\n\nMay increase risk of AFib (dose-dependent)\n\nOmega-3 is correlated with ↑ vagal effect (↓ HR, etc.), but there is a subset that increased risk of brady, APC → ↑ risk of AFib\n\nBill Harris is aka “The Codfather” 😆\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Fibrates\n\nFenofibrates are really the only ones we use. We often use it with a statin.\nIt’s 3rd line for hyperTG\n\nFirst line is statin, second line is Omega-3\n\nRecall, goal is to get TG < 150\nLow glycemic diet, eliminating added sugars will lower TG dramatically\n\n\n\n4.2.6 Niacin\n\nDr. O’Keefe is not a fan.
