$$
\text{Pulse Pressure} = \text{SBP} - \text{DBP}
$$

-   the difference between SBP and DBP

-   *normal* PP is $\approx 40 \ \text{mm Hg}$

-   *narrow* PP: $\text{PP} < 0.25 \times \text{SBP}$

    -   e.g. if SBP is 100 mmHg, then a PP \< 25 would be considered "narrow"
    -   may indicate a "low-output" state in the setting of HF; [associated with ↑ mortality in HFrEF](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/36/18/1106/2293212)

-   *wide* PP: $\text{PP} > 100 \ \text{mm Hg}$

-   Deviations in PP that are "normal"

    -   Endurance runners may have an *increased* PP

    -   Elderly pts may have a *widened* PP due to ↓ compliance of the large elastic aa. ("hardening of the arteries")

        -   LV contracts against stiffer, less compliant aa. → both SBP and DBP ↑ and *widening* of PP
