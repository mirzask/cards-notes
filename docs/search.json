Neurogenic OH is associated with blunted compensatory HR increase (ΔHR <15 beats per minute). Conversely, individuals with non-neurogenic OH will typically demonstrate ΔHR ≥15 beats per minute within 3 minutes of standing.

A ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio <0.5 bpm/mm Hg after 3 minutes standing indicates a diagnosis of neurogenic OH and discriminates neurogenic OH from non-neurogenic OH with significantly better sensitivity than ΔHR alone.

Talk to your health care provider about specific guidelines (e.g., if you have heart or kidney conditions, you may have a limit for fluids)\n\nDrink fluids throughout the day\nSome people drink a “bolus” 2 cups of extra water (about 480ml or 16oz) before they get up from a lying position, before they exercise, after a meal, or when they feel symptoms\n\nFood – avoid large, carbohydrate-filled meals\n\nIt may help to eat 3 small meals + 3 snacks a day (instead of 3 large meals)\n\n\nE: Evaluate, Educate, and Exercise (Safely)\n\nEvaluate (check) your blood pressure yourself at home (or have someone help you) using a device approved by your health care provider.\n\nAsk how you should measure your blood pressure first thing in the morning (or after lying at least one minute), then after standing for 1 minute and 3 minutes).\nHowever, only take standing blood pressure if you can safely check your blood pressure without risk of falling down.\nKeep track of these recordings and share them with your health care provider. It is helpful if you can also record your heart rate and what you were doing before blood pressure (e.g., exercising, eating).\n\nEducate yourself by talking with your health care provider or pharmacist\n\nReview what medications may make your OH worse.\nIf you take medications for high blood pressure, your health care provider may decrease the dosage or adjust the timing so you take these before bed.\nIf non-drug options do not help your OH condition, talk with your health care provider about medications that may help.\nIf you become dehydrated (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea), please contact your health care provider.\n\nEducate yourself and important people in your life about your OH condition.\n\nConnect with others through and consider a support group, such as http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/\nAlthough we don’t yet have research on mindfulness stress reduction techniques (such as meditation), some patients find these helpful.\n\nExercise – in a safe way – should be a goal for you with input from your health care provider.\nHave someone with you when you exercise (or stay connected with a smart phone)\n\nDrink fluids before and after you exercise, and sit down for 20 minutes after exercising\nAvoid exercising too hard or getting too hot\nSome people can develop worsening symptoms with exercise – talk with a specialist about how to exercise safely, progressing gradually, such as with a reclining bicycle, a rowing machine, or swimming.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.2 A to F\nRecommendations for patients with orthostatic hypotension: From A to F (Figueroa, Basford, and Low 2010)\n“Your physician has determined that you have orthostatic hypotension. This means that your blood pressure drops when you stand up, making you feel dizzy or perhaps even pass out. The following may help.\n\nA: Abdominal compression\n\nWear an abdominal binder when out of bed.\n\nB: Bolus of water\n\nOn bad days, drink two 8-ounce glasses of cold water prior to prolonged standing.\n\nB (continued): Bed up\n\nSleep with the head of the bed elevated 4 inches.\n\nC: Countermaneuvers\n\nContract the muscles below your waist for about half a minute at a time to raise your blood pressure during prolonged standing or when you become symptomatic.\nSpecific techniques include:\n\nToe-raising\nLeg-crossing and contraction\nThigh muscle co-contraction\nBending at the waist\nSlow marching in place\nLeg elevation\n\n\nD: Drugs\n\nDrugs such as midodrine (ProAmatine), pyridostigmine (Mestinon), and fludrocortisone (Florinef) can be used to raise your blood pressure.\nRecognize that some drugs you take can lower blood pressure.\n\nE: Education\n\nRecognize symptoms that indicate your standing blood pressure is falling.\nRecognize the conditions that lower blood pressure, such as a heavy meal, positional changes, heat, exercise, or a hot bath.\nLearn the things you can do to raise your blood pressure.\n\nE (continued): Exercise\n\nAvoid inactivity and consider a gentle exercise program.\n\nF: Fluids and salt\n\nYou need plenty of salt and fluids.”"

    "text": "4.6 Pharmacologic Treatment Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidodrine\n\nA common starting dose is 5 mg three times a day; most patients respond best to 10 mg three times a day.\nAs its duration of action is short (2 to 4 hours), it should be taken before arising in the morning, before lunch, and in the midafternoon. To avoid nocturnal supine hypertension, doses should not be taken after the midafternoon, and a dose should be omitted if the supine or sitting blood pressure is greater than 180/100 mm Hg.\nMain side effects are supine hypertension, scalp paresthesias, and pilomotor reactions (goosebumps)\nIneffective when plasma volume is reduced\n\nFludrocortisone\n\nusual dose is 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day, but it may be increased to 0.4 to 0.6 mg/day in patients with refractory orthostatic hypotension\na synthetic mineralocorticoid that has a pressor effect as a result of its ability to expand plasma volume and increase vascular alpha-adrenoceptor sensitivity\nhelpful when plasma volume fails to adequately increase with salt supplementation and for patients who cannot ingest enough salt or do not respond adequately to midodrine.\nContraindications: HF and CKD\nThe potential risks are severe hypokalemia and excessive supine hypertension. Frequent monitoring of serum potassium, a diet high in potassium, and regular checks of supine blood pressure are advised, especially at higher doses, when added to midodrine, or in elderly patients who tend to poorly tolerate the medication.\n\nPyridostigmine\n\nDosing is started at 30 mg two to three times a day and is gradually increased to 60 mg three times a day.\n\nOnce daily option: Mestinon Timespan, a 180-mg slow-release pyridostigmine tablet, can be taken once a day\n\nCan be combined with midodrine: effectiveness can be enhanced by combining each dose of pyridostigmine with 5 mg of midodrine without occurrence of supine hypertension\nmost adequate for patients with mild to moderate orthostatic hypotension"

Dr. O’Keefe gave an example of post-transplant patient on Atorva 80 who got rhabdo and died a few months later.\nDelta between 40 mg and 80 mg of atorva is 48% → 51% reduction (delta is only 3%)\n\nAtorva is the 🌟\nRule of thumb: 6% reduction when doubling a statin dose. Better off adding ezetimibe: zetio on its own 16% reduction, zetia + statin (synergistic effect): 25% reduction.\nNewborn baby LDL is 25-30 mg/dL. Hunter/gatherers have also been studied and have like 40-50 mg/dL.\n\nYou don’t want a 0 LDL! Cholesterol is an important molecule, so you need some.\n\nDr. O’Keefe gets nervous getting someones LDL < 30\nSide effects are not related to LDL level, rather related to statin dose.\nMnemonic for statin side effects “LIPITOR”:\n\nLiver effects\nIncreased blood sugar\nPain (muscles)\nImpaired memory\nTiredness/Fatigue\nOther (headaches)\nRhabdomyolysis\n\nSAMSON trial (BMJ, 2021)\n\n200 statin intolerant patients; “n-of-1” experiments\nCompared atorva 20 mg vs placebo\nIntolerable muscle sx: 9% in statin group discontinued, 7% discontinued placebo\n\nDr. O’Keefe: “when I start someone on a statin, I also start them on CoQ10.”\n\nIf patient c/o myalgias, he’ll increase the dose of CoQ10\n\nPitavastatin\n\na “cool” statin\nNot as strong as atorva\n4 mg dose \\(\\approx\\) 20 mg of atorva\nUnlike atorva, rosuva, simva, Pitavastatin less likely to induce DM in patients.

We often use it with a statin.\nIt’s 3rd line for hyperTG\n\nFirst line is statin, second line is Omega-3\n\nRecall, goal is to get TG < 150\nLow glycemic diet, eliminating added sugars will lower TG dramatically\n\n\n\n7.2.6 Niacin\n\nDr. O’Keefe is not a fan.

    "text": "15.2 AVS for Weight Loss\nNo one thing universally helpful to lose weight. The weight loss evidence suggests that different things work for different people and it is hard to predict which plan will be best for one person without trial and error. \n\nThere are some weight loss drugs available (some with FDA approved indications for weight loss and some used off-label), but these have only been studied in those with a BMI of 30 or higher. Your BMI today was @BMIE@\n\nThere is some more recent studies that the types of food you are eating and when you are eating may matter as much (or more) than the absolute number of calories you eat. In short, it seems like it may be beneficial to eat your calories during a limited time window (10AM-6PM), and to avoid sugar, refined grains (white rice, white bread, etc.) and highly processed foods - this way, you can eat all you want of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and dairy without having to calorie count. Try to limit carbohydrates somewhat or eat carbohydrates in the middle part of the day when your body is best equipped to metabolize these. In particular, avoid eating late at night (after 7-8 PM).\n\nSome good recent articles:\nhttps://health.clevelandclinic.org/intermittent-fasting-4-different-types-explained/ \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/well/eat/counting-calories-weight-loss-diet-dieting-low-carb-low-fat.html\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/intermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156\n\nRemember too that getting enough exercise and sleeping enough also seem to contribute to healthy weight loss.\n\nIf you want to get additional advice, there is also the Medical Weight Loss Clinic at One Hundred Oaks where they can do a comprehensive assessment and make nutrition & exercise recommendations tailored to your needs."

Recent studies demonstrate that most patients with chest pain and a “new” LBBB do not have a STEMI (Jain et al., 2011; Kontos et al., 2011). (Source)\n\n\nIf a patient has taken a PDE-5 inhibitor, e.g. viagra, you should wait 24 hrs before giving nitroglycerin\n\nException: tadalafil (Cialias), where you should wait 48 hrs\n\n\n\n18.7.1 Revascularization in STEMI\n\nComplete revascularization is superior to culprit-only revac for the primary endpoint of CV death and MI.(Mehta et al. 2019) Of note, these patients were NOT in shock.\n\nRevascularization of the non-culprit lesions need not occur at the time as primary PCI (revascularization of the culprit lesion(s)). In other words, can use a staged revascularization strategy.\nOptimal timing of staged procedure unclear\n\nPre-discharge or within 30 days resulted in same outcome\n\nIn the COMPLETE trial, complete revascularization was not performed at index Primary PCI\n\nFor patients who present in cardiogenic shock (See Chapter 41), mortality was lower among those who had culprit-only PCI rather than immediate (not staged) multivessel PCI. (Thiele et al. 2017)\n\nAny potential advantage of multivessel PCI is outweighed by mortality hazard of the initial longer procedure.\nMain proven goal in shock is rapid and complete reperfusion of culprit vessel\n\n\n\n\n18.7.2 STEMI at non-PCI hospital\n\nIf expecting delay, i.e. first medical contact to primary PCI >120 min\n\nPharmaco-invasive strategy\n\nFull dose lysis, heparin, clopidogrel (loading dose) and\n\nClopidogrel 300 mg (or 75 mg if > 75 yo)\n\nSend to PCI-capable hospital for routine PCI\nOutcomes equivalent to and safe as primary PCI\n\nCAPTIM (Bonnefoy et al. 2009; Steg et al. 2003)\nWEST (P.

Thus, in theory torsemide should be more effective, but the data doesn’t really pan out.\nTorsemide vs. Lasix: Torsemide reduces hospital readmissions for HF (DiNicolantonio 2012)\nRemember that during acute decompensated HF, Na retention is more avid\n\nBob Centor gives Torsemide (prefers once daily) to new HF pts and existing HF pts who req’d metolazone during hospitalization. He’ll then Rx metolazone PRN (based on daily weights).

Timing of switching should be 24 hours after the last dose of a given drug, with the exception of when escalating to prasugrel (P) or ticagrelor (T), when the LD can be given regardless of the timing and dosing of the previous clopidogrel regimen. *Consider de-escalation with clopidogrel 75-mg MD (24 hours after last prasugrel or ticagrelor dose) in patients with bleeding or bleeding concerns. B, Switching between oral agents in the late/very late phase. In the late/very late phase (>30 days from the index event), switching should occur with the administration of an MD 24 hours after the last dose of a given drug, with the exception of patients changing from ticagrelor to prasugrel therapy, for whom an LD should be considered. De-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel should occur with administration of an LD 24 hours after the last dose of ticagrelor (but in patients in whom de-escalation occurs because of bleeding or bleeding concerns, an MD of clopidogrel should be considered). *Consider de-escalation with clopidogrel 75-mg MD (24 hours after last prasugrel or ticagrelor dose) in patients with bleeding or bleeding concerns."
