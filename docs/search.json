Under normal conditions, there is a slight increase in heart rate with associated venoconstriction and arteriolar constriction preserving systolic, but slightly increasing, DBP, effective venous return and maintaining cardiac output. OH reflects failure of the homeostatic reflex autonomic response to postural change at many potential levels (baroreceptors, autonomic afferents, central processing, autonomic efferents, and peripheral sympathetic receptors). (Fedorowski et al. 2022)\n\n\n\nSource: Table 3 of Figueroa et al.

Neurogenic OH is associated with blunted compensatory HR increase (ŒîHR &lt;15 beats per minute). Conversely, individuals with non-neurogenic OH will typically demonstrate ŒîHR ‚â•15 beats per minute within 3 minutes of standing. (Fedorowski et al. 2022)\n\n\n\nInterpreting orthostatics\n\npositive for orthostasis if ‚Üì SBP of of ‚â• 20 mmHg or ‚Üì DBP of ‚â• 10 mmHg\n\nfor HTN pts, a ‚Üì of SBP ‚â• 30 mmHg may be a more appropriate criteria (Freeman et al. 2011)\n\nHR response\n\nif HR ‚Üë by &lt; 15 bpm after standing ‚Üí suggests neurogenic orthostatic hypOtension\nif HR ‚Üë by &gt; 20 bpm after standing ‚Üí suggests volume depletion\nif HR ‚Üë by &gt; 30 bpm after standing ‚Üí suggests postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)\n\nPOTS usually presents with typical orthstatic Sx, but do not meet BP criteria for orthostasis, i.e.¬†little/no ‚Üì in BP w/ postural ‚àÜ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚àÜ SBP cutoff in HTN patients\n\n\n\nFor HTN pts, a ‚Üì of SBP ‚â• 30 mmHg may be a more appropriate criteria (Freeman et al. 2011)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta \\text{HR}}{\\Delta \\text{SBP}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNeurogenic OH more likely if \\(\\frac{\\Delta \\text{HR}}{\\Delta \\text{SBP}}\\) &lt; 0.5 bpm/mmHg after 3 minutes standing\n\n\nNeurogenic OH can be diagnosed accurately by measuring the ratio of the HR increase and dividing it by the fall in SBP (ŒîHR/ŒîSBP) to provide a marker of cardiac baroreflex gain. A ŒîHR/ŒîSBP ratio &lt;0.5 bpm/mm Hg after 3 minutes standing indicates a diagnosis of neurogenic OH and discriminates neurogenic OH from non-neurogenic OH with significantly better sensitivity than ŒîHR alone.

Talk to your health care provider about specific guidelines (e.g., if you have heart or kidney conditions, you may have a limit for fluids)\n\nDrink fluids throughout the day\nSome people drink a ‚Äúbolus‚Äù 2 cups of extra water (about 480ml or 16oz) before they get up from a lying position, before they exercise, after a meal, or when they feel symptoms\n\nFood ‚Äì avoid large, carbohydrate-filled meals\n\nIt may help to eat 3 small meals + 3 snacks a day (instead of 3 large meals)\n\n\nE: Evaluate, Educate, and Exercise (Safely)\n\nEvaluate (check) your blood pressure yourself at home (or have someone help you) using a device approved by your health care provider.\n\nAsk how you should measure your blood pressure first thing in the morning (or after lying at least one minute), then after standing for 1 minute and 3 minutes).\nHowever, only take standing blood pressure if you can safely check your blood pressure without risk of falling down.\nKeep track of these recordings and share them with your health care provider. It is helpful if you can also record your heart rate and what you were doing before blood pressure (e.g., exercising, eating).\n\nEducate yourself by talking with your health care provider or pharmacist\n\nReview what medications may make your OH worse.\nIf you take medications for high blood pressure, your health care provider may decrease the dosage or adjust the timing so you take these before bed.\nIf non-drug options do not help your OH condition, talk with your health care provider about medications that may help.\nIf you become dehydrated (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea), please contact your health care provider.\n\nEducate yourself and important people in your life about your OH condition.\n\nConnect with others through and consider a support group, such as http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/\nAlthough we don‚Äôt yet have research on mindfulness stress reduction techniques (such as meditation), some patients find these helpful.\n\nExercise ‚Äì in a safe way ‚Äì should be a goal for you with input from your health care provider.\nHave someone with you when you exercise (or stay connected with a smart phone)\n\nDrink fluids before and after you exercise, and sit down for 20 minutes after exercising\nAvoid exercising too hard or getting too hot\nSome people can develop worsening symptoms with exercise ‚Äì talk with a specialist about how to exercise safely, progressing gradually, such as with a reclining bicycle, a rowing machine, or swimming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations for patients with orthostatic hypotension: From A to F (Figueroa, Basford, and Low 2010)\n‚ÄúYour physician has determined that you have orthostatic hypotension. This means that your blood pressure drops when you stand up, making you feel dizzy or perhaps even pass out. The following may help.\n\nA: Abdominal compression\n\nWear an abdominal binder when out of bed.\n\nB: Bolus of water\n\nOn bad days, drink two 8-ounce glasses of cold water prior to prolonged standing.\n\nB (continued): Bed up\n\nSleep with the head of the bed elevated 4 inches.\n\nC: Countermaneuvers\n\nContract the muscles below your waist for about half a minute at a time to raise your blood pressure during prolonged standing or when you become symptomatic.\nSpecific techniques include:\n\nToe-raising\nLeg-crossing and contraction\nThigh muscle co-contraction\nBending at the waist\nSlow marching in place\nLeg elevation\n\n\nD: Drugs\n\nDrugs such as midodrine (ProAmatine), pyridostigmine (Mestinon), and fludrocortisone (Florinef) can be used to raise your blood pressure.\nRecognize that some drugs you take can lower blood pressure.\n\nE: Education\n\nRecognize symptoms that indicate your standing blood pressure is falling.\nRecognize the conditions that lower blood pressure, such as a heavy meal, positional changes, heat, exercise, or a hot bath.\nLearn the things you can do to raise your blood pressure.\n\nE (continued): Exercise\n\nAvoid inactivity and consider a gentle exercise program.\n\nF: Fluids and salt\n\nYou need plenty of salt and fluids.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidodrine\n\nA common starting dose is 5 mg three times a day; most patients respond best to 10 mg three times a day.\nAs its duration of action is short (2 to 4 hours), it should be taken before arising in the morning, before lunch, and in the midafternoon.

Neurogenic OH is associated with blunted compensatory HR increase (ŒîHR &lt;15 beats per minute). Conversely, individuals with non-neurogenic OH will typically demonstrate ŒîHR ‚â•15 beats per minute within 3 minutes of standing.

A ŒîHR/ŒîSBP ratio &lt;0.5 bpm/mm Hg after 3 minutes standing indicates a diagnosis of neurogenic OH and discriminates neurogenic OH from non-neurogenic OH with significantly better sensitivity than ŒîHR alone.

Talk to your health care provider about specific guidelines (e.g., if you have heart or kidney conditions, you may have a limit for fluids)\n\nDrink fluids throughout the day\nSome people drink a ‚Äúbolus‚Äù 2 cups of extra water (about 480ml or 16oz) before they get up from a lying position, before they exercise, after a meal, or when they feel symptoms\n\nFood ‚Äì avoid large, carbohydrate-filled meals\n\nIt may help to eat 3 small meals + 3 snacks a day (instead of 3 large meals)\n\n\nE: Evaluate, Educate, and Exercise (Safely)\n\nEvaluate (check) your blood pressure yourself at home (or have someone help you) using a device approved by your health care provider.\n\nAsk how you should measure your blood pressure first thing in the morning (or after lying at least one minute), then after standing for 1 minute and 3 minutes).\nHowever, only take standing blood pressure if you can safely check your blood pressure without risk of falling down.\nKeep track of these recordings and share them with your health care provider. It is helpful if you can also record your heart rate and what you were doing before blood pressure (e.g., exercising, eating).\n\nEducate yourself by talking with your health care provider or pharmacist\n\nReview what medications may make your OH worse.\nIf you take medications for high blood pressure, your health care provider may decrease the dosage or adjust the timing so you take these before bed.\nIf non-drug options do not help your OH condition, talk with your health care provider about medications that may help.\nIf you become dehydrated (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea), please contact your health care provider.\n\nEducate yourself and important people in your life about your OH condition.\n\nConnect with others through and consider a support group, such as http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/\nAlthough we don‚Äôt yet have research on mindfulness stress reduction techniques (such as meditation), some patients find these helpful.\n\nExercise ‚Äì in a safe way ‚Äì should be a goal for you with input from your health care provider.\nHave someone with you when you exercise (or stay connected with a smart phone)\n\nDrink fluids before and after you exercise, and sit down for 20 minutes after exercising\nAvoid exercising too hard or getting too hot\nSome people can develop worsening symptoms with exercise ‚Äì talk with a specialist about how to exercise safely, progressing gradually, such as with a reclining bicycle, a rowing machine, or swimming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations for patients with orthostatic hypotension: From A to F (Figueroa, Basford, and Low 2010)\n‚ÄúYour physician has determined that you have orthostatic hypotension. This means that your blood pressure drops when you stand up, making you feel dizzy or perhaps even pass out. The following may help.\n\nA: Abdominal compression\n\nWear an abdominal binder when out of bed.\n\nB: Bolus of water\n\nOn bad days, drink two 8-ounce glasses of cold water prior to prolonged standing.\n\nB (continued): Bed up\n\nSleep with the head of the bed elevated 4 inches.\n\nC: Countermaneuvers\n\nContract the muscles below your waist for about half a minute at a time to raise your blood pressure during prolonged standing or when you become symptomatic.\nSpecific techniques include:\n\nToe-raising\nLeg-crossing and contraction\nThigh muscle co-contraction\nBending at the waist\nSlow marching in place\nLeg elevation\n\n\nD: Drugs\n\nDrugs such as midodrine (ProAmatine), pyridostigmine (Mestinon), and fludrocortisone (Florinef) can be used to raise your blood pressure.\nRecognize that some drugs you take can lower blood pressure.\n\nE: Education\n\nRecognize symptoms that indicate your standing blood pressure is falling.\nRecognize the conditions that lower blood pressure, such as a heavy meal, positional changes, heat, exercise, or a hot bath.\nLearn the things you can do to raise your blood pressure.\n\nE (continued): Exercise\n\nAvoid inactivity and consider a gentle exercise program.\n\nF: Fluids and salt\n\nYou need plenty of salt and fluids.‚Äù"

In the late/very late phase (&gt;30 days from the index event), switching should occur with the administration of an MD 24 hours after the last dose of a given drug, with the exception of patients changing from ticagrelor to prasugrel therapy, for whom an LD should be considered. De-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel should occur with administration of an LD 24 hours after the last dose of ticagrelor (but in patients in whom de-escalation occurs because of bleeding or bleeding concerns, an MD of clopidogrel should be considered). *Consider de-escalation with clopidogrel 75-mg MD (24 hours after last prasugrel or ticagrelor dose) in patients with bleeding or bleeding concerns."
