# Brugada Syndrome

-   Diagnostic criteria ([Source](https://twitter.com/SeanMurphyMBBCh/status/1289640701882335232))
    -   ST elevation of 2mm or more with type 1 ("coved") morphology seen in 1 or more of leads V~1~-V~3~
    -   occurs spontaneously or provoked by Na-channel blockers
    -   other causes of STE have been ruled-out (RV or LAD ischemia, acute PE)
-   Pathophysiology
    -   Related to loss of function of Na-channels
    -   Genetic link with SCN5A gene mutations, which are found in 30%
    -   Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern but incomplete penetrance & variable expression
-   Presentation
    -   Syncope, nocturnal agonal breathing from polymorphic VT (PMVT)/VF or sudden cardiac death
    -   PMVT/VF are assoc w/ bradycardia or vagal events → commonly occur when sleeping (old name: Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome)
    -   Fever also a trigger
-   Management
    -   Antipyretics
    -   If symptomatic: **ICD placement**
    -   Patients who decline ICD or have recurrent ICD shocks → quinidine, amio or consider catheter ablation
