# Syncope {#sec-syncope}

## Note

### H&P

``` text
*** Denied HA, diaphoresis, n/v, cold or warm sensation, CP, SOB, palpitations, deja vu, jamais vu, blurry vision or lightheadedness prior to the episode. No witnessed cyanosis while unconscious, tongue bite/laceration, incontinence, limb twitching or seizure-like activity. Following the episode, the pt was not confused and had normal/baseline mentation.

Syncope
- Calgary Score (VVS)
    - ≥ -2 suggests vasovagal syncope
- EGSYS score
    - < 3 makes cardiac syncope *less* likely
- History: prodromal Sx? dehydration? infectious Sx? deconditioning/malnutrition?
- Medication review: *** anti-HTNs, diuretics, vasodilators, antipsychotics, anti-depressants, EtOH, opiates
- Labs:
    - beta-HCG (if +, consider ectopic pregnancy)
    - Trop, BNP (if indicated)
- EKG
    - try to exclude BLOWHard conditions
- TTE
- Telemetry
  - Outpatient: consider mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry (MCOT)
- Orthostatics
- Any concerning features to suggest adrenal insufficiency?
- Consider autonomics consult if indicated
- PT/OT
- Consider home safety evaluation

Orthostatic hypotension
- Encouraged to rise from resting position gradually, avoid standing motionless (even if still, tense leg mm.)
- Compression waist high stocking (30-40 mmHg)
- Abdominal binder
- Increase salt consumption 6-10 g/d
- Encouraged water intake 2-3 L/d
- If Sx persist despite the above interventions, consider fludrocortisone
    - Alternative pharmacotherapy: midodrine

## 4 General Causes

-   Reflex-mediated
    -   Vasovagal (most common cause)
    -   Situational, e.g. coughing, micturition, etc.
    -   Carotid sinus hypersentivity
-   Cardiac
    -   arrhythmia, e.g. SSS, VT, AV block, etc.
    -   obstruction, e.g. severe AS, HCM, PE, etc.
    -   massive MI
-   Orthostatic
    -   intravascular volume depletion (e.g. dehydration, blood loss) vs. abnml autonomic reflexes
-   Neuro
    -   Central → brain steam lesions, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, Parkinsonism, Shy-Drager syndrome
    -   Peripheral → pure autonomic failure, diabetic neuropathy

## Seizure-like activity with Syncope

Pts w/ LOC d/t syncope can have brief (\< 15 seconds) of brief asymmetric or symmetric myoclonic or tonic-clonic movements (not a seizure!). Typically occurs within 10 seconds after LOC, but not before.

## Mimics

-   Seizures
    -   History:
        -   head turning during the event (seizure \> syncope; +LR for seizure 14)
        -   unusual posturing during the event (seizure \> syncope; +LR 13)
        -   urinary incontinence (+LR 6.7)
        -   absence of presyncope (+LR 5.6)
    -   Exam:
        -   tongue laceration (+LR 16)
        -   no recall of unusual behaviors before LOC (+LR 4)

## Reflex-mediated Syncope

-   Common precipitants:
    -   pain/emotion/fear
    -   warm/hot environment
    -   afferent visceral stimuli, e.g. distended stomach or bladder
    -   pressure on carotid sinus baroreceptor, e.g. a tight collared shirt while turning the neck
-   Prodromal Sx
    -   Cause: efferent vagal component of the reflex leads to autonomic symptoms
    -   **History**: HA, sweating, a sense of cold or warmth, n/v, abdominal discomfort, or urge to defecate
-   Vasovagal syncope
    -   usually initiated by prolonged sitting or standing → \~ 500-800 mL of blood remains in the distensible vv. below the ♥

### Vasovagal Syncope Score (Calgary Score)

-   Vasovagal syncope is suggested if score ≥ -2

![Grading for Vasovagal Syncope Score (Calgary Score)](images/syncope-calgary-vvs.jpg)

## Cardiac Syncope

-   Etiology: a marked ↓ in CO due to cardiopulmonary disease, such as arrhythmia, structural heart disease, or PE → cerebral hypOperfusion
-   History
    -   may occur at rest, in the supine position, or during effort when the pt is unable to ↑ CO to meet the increased demand
    -   may be preceded by CP, SOB, or palpitations
    -   may have witnessed cyanosis while unconscious

### EGSYS Score

-   Score range: -2 to 12
-   Higher score → ↑ likelihood of cardiac syncope
-   EGSYS \< 3, suggests *low* likelihood of cardiac syncope

### Things to rule-out on ECG

4 cardiac conditions to look for on ECG in all patients presenting with syncope (**BLOWH**ard) [Source](http://embasic.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/13-syncope-show-notes1.pdf):

-   **B**rugada
-   **LO**ng QT
-   **W**PW
-   **H**CM/LVH

### Orthostatic hypOtension

-   [Great overview](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532938/) on orthostatic hypotension
-   Performing orthostatics
    -   baseline: check BP, HR after pt lying down for at least 5 minutes
    -   after 1 minute of standing
    -   after 3 minutes of standing
-   Interpreting orthostatics
    -   positive for orthostasis if ↓ SBP of of ≥ 20 mmHg or ↓ DBP of ≥ 10 mmHg
        -   for HTN pts, a ↓ of SBP ≥ 30 mmHg may be a more appropriate criteria [^syncope-1]
    -   HR response
        -   if HR ↑ by \< 15 bpm after standing → suggests neurogenic orthostatic hypOtension
        -   if HR ↑ by \> 20 bpm after standing → suggests volume depletion
        -   if HR ↑ by \> 30 bpm after standing → suggests postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
            -   POTS usually presents with typical orthstatic Sx, but do *not* meet BP criteria for orthostasis, i.e. little/no ↓ in BP w/ postural ∆

[^syncope-1]: Freeman R, Wieling W, Axelrod FB, et al. Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypotension, neurally mediated syncope and the postural tachycardia syndrome. *Clin Auton Res*. 2011;21(2):69-72. <doi:10.1007/s10286-011-0119-5>

## Clinical Pearls

-   In a pt presenting with syncope and **elevated** $\beta$-hCG, think about ectopic pregnancy as possible underlying cause
-   In a pt presenting with syncope and associated **severe HA**, think about SAH or intracranial hemorrhage
-   In a pt presenting with syncope and **neuro deficits**, think about stroke/TIA or intracranial bleed
-   In a young pt presenting with syncope **during exercise**, think about anomalous coronary artery
    -   normally, folks will complain of syncope *after* exercise
-   Orthostatic hypOtension causes the postural instability in pts w/ Parkinsonism
-   **Shy-Drager syndrome**: Parkinsonism predominantly w/ orthostasis
