It fills with blood while resting and then empties when it squeezes (this squeezing is what produces a heartbeat). When the heart is either too stiff or too weak, the pump does not work properly and does not send enough blood through the body to meet its needs. This is called heart failure. Heart failure does not mean that the heart has completely “failed”; it means that it is not working as well as it should. In some people, this results in an overflow of excess blood and fluid that backs up into other parts of the body, including the lungs, belly, and legs.}, number={10}, journal={JAMA}, author={Baman, Jayson R. and Ahmad, Faraz S.}, year={2020}, month={Sep}, pages={1015} }

HFrEF occurs when the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40% or less and is accompanied by progressive left ventricular dilatation and adverse cardiac remodeling. Assessment for heart failure begins with obtaining a medical history and physical examination. Also central to diagnosis are elevated natriuretic peptides above age- and context-specific thresholds and identification of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 40% or less as measured by echocardiography. Treatment strategies include the use of diuretics to relieve symptoms and application of an expanding armamentarium of disease-modifying drug and device therapies. Unless there are specific contraindications, patients with HFrEF should be treated with a β-blocker and one of an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker as foundational therapy, with addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with persistent symptoms. Ivabradine and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate also have a role in the care of certain patients with HFrEF. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have further improved disease outcomes, significantly reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality irrespective of diabetes status, and vericiguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, reduces heart failure hospitalization in high-risk patients with HFrEF. Device therapies may be beneficial in specific subpopulations, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with interventricular dyssynchrony, transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation, and implantable cardiac defibrillators in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction particularly of ischemic etiology.HFrEF is a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of HFrEF has seen significant scientific breakthrough in recent decades, and the ability to alter the natural history of the disease has never been better. Recent developments include SGLT2 inhibitors, vericiguat, and transcatheter mitral valve repair, all of which incrementally improve prognosis beyond foundational neurohormonal therapies. Disease morbidity and mortality remain high, with a 5-year survival rate of 25% after hospitalization for HFrEF.}, number={5}, journal={JAMA}, author={Murphy, Sean P. and Ibrahim, Nasrien E. and Januzzi, James L., Jr}, year={2020}, month={Aug}, pages={488–504} }

 @article{Ahmad_Desai_2020, title={Quadruple Therapy Is the New Standard of Care for HFrEF∗}, volume={8}, ISSN={2213-1779}, DOI={10.1016/j.jchf.2020.06.004}, abstractNote={The use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is underprescribed in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
This study sought to examine whether targeted and tailored electronic health record (EHR) alerts recommending GDMT in eligible patients with HFrEF improves GDMT use.
PROMPT-HF (PRagmatic trial Of Messaging to Providers about Treatment of Heart Failure) was a pragmatic, EHR-based, cluster-randomized comparative effectiveness trial. A total of 100 providers caring for patients with HFrEF were randomized to either an alert or usual care. The alert notified providers of individualized GDMT recommendations along with patient characteristics. The primary outcome was an increase in the number of GDMT classes prescribed at 30 days postrandomization. Providers were surveyed on knowledge of guidelines and user experience.
The study enrolled 1,310 ambulatory patients with HFrEF from April to October 2021. Median age was 72 years; 31% were female; 18% were Black; and median left ventricular ejection fraction was 32%. At baseline, 84% of participants were receiving β-blockers, 71% received a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor, 29% received a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and 11% received a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. The primary outcome occurred in 176 of 685 (26%) participants in the alert arm vs 117 of 625 (19%) in the usual care arm, thus increasing GDMT class prescription by >40% after alert exposure (adjusted relative risk: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.03-1.93; P = 0.03). The number of patients needed to alert to result in an increase in addition of GDMT classes was 14. A total of 79% of alerted providers agreed that the alert was effective at enabling improved prescription of medical therapy for HF.
A real-time, targeted, and tailored EHR-based alerting system for outpatients with HFrEF led to significantly higher rates of GDMT at 30 days when compared with usual care. This low-cost intervention can be rapidly integrated into clinical care and accelerate adoption of high-value therapies in heart failure. (PRagmatic trial Of Messaging to Providers about Treatment of Heart Failure [PROMPT-HF; NCT04514458])
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is one of the most common chronic illnesses in the United States and carries significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for patients with HFrEF has been shown to dramatically improve outcomes, but adoption of these treatments remains generally low. Possible explanations for poor GDMT uptake include lack of knowledge about recommended management strategies and provider reluctance due to uncertainties regarding application of said guidelines to real-world practice. One way to overcome these barriers is by harnessing the electronic health record (EHR) to create patient-centered “best practice alerts” (BPAs) that can guide clinicians to prescribe appropriate medical therapies. If found to be effective, these low-cost interventions can be rapidly applied across large integrated healthcare systems. The PRagmatic Trial Of Messaging to Providers about Treatment of Heart Failure (PROMPT-HF) trial is a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that tailored and timely alerting of recommended GDMT in heart failure (HF) will result in greater adherence to guidelines when compared with usual care. PROMPT-HF has completed enrollment of 1,310 ambulatory patients with HFrEF cared for by 100 providers who were randomized to receive a BPA vs usual care. The BPA alerted providers to GDMT recommended for their patients and displayed current left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) along with the most recent blood pressure, heart rate, serum potassium and creatinine levels, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. It also linked to an order set customized to the patient that suggests medications within each GDMT class not already prescribed. Our goal is to examine whether tailored EHR-based alerting for outpatients with HFrEF will lead to higher rates of GDMT at 30 days post randomization when compared with usual care. Additionally, we are assessing clinical outcomes such as hospital readmissions and death between the alert versus usual care group.

Thus, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing torsemide versus furosemide in patients with systolic HF using OVID MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica (Embase), Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar was performed. Extracted data included study design, sample characteristics, intervention, outcomes and control for potential confounding factors. A DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to compute summary risk ratios for HF and cardiovascular (CV) readmission outcomes. Two randomized trials comparing furosemide with torsemide in 471 patients with systolic HF were identified. Compared to furosemide, torsemide significantly reduced total HF readmissions (relative risk [RR]: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.28–0.61, p < 0.0001) and HF readmissions (RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33–0.84, p = 0.008) as well as CV readmissions (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60–0.98, p = 0.03) in patients with “at least 1 readmission.” Moreover, compared with furosemide, torsemide caused a 14% reduction in all-cause mortality (RR: 0.86 [0.53–1.39], p = 0.54). Compared with furosemide, torsemide significantly reduces HF and CV-related hospital readmissions in systolic HF. Furthermore, torsemide is associated with a trend in reducing all-cause mortality.}, number={5}, journal={Future Cardiology}, publisher={Future Medicine}, author={DiNicolantonio, James J}, year={2012}, month={Sep}, pages={707–728} }
